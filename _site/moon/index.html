            <h1>Moon</h1>
            <p>The Moon is heavily cratered and the only celestial satelite orbitting
                the Earth. The origin of the moon is believed to be the result of a
                major collision between Earth and another object which launched a ton 
                of debris into space. This debris would slowly gravitate towards each other
                and eventually form the moon as we know it today.
